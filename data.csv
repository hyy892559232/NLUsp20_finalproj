"Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners.",Our bodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener.
"So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many—either to have it sterile with idleness, or manured with industry—why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills.","Depending on what we plant—weeds or lettuce, or one kind of herb rather than a variety, the garden will either be barren and useless, or rich and productive."
"If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost'rous conclusions.","If we didn’t have rational minds to counterbalance our emotions and desires, our bodily urges would take over."
"But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts.","Thankfully, we have reason to cool our raging lusts."

"I hate the Moor, And it is thought abroad that ’twixt my sheets He’s done my office.","I hate the Moor, and there’s a widespread rumor that he’s slept with my wife."

"But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?","But how would you praise a truly good woman, someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her?"
"She that was ever fair and never proud, Had tongue at will and yet was never loud, Never lacked gold and yet went never gay, Fled from her wish and yet said “Now I may,” She that being angered, her revenge being nigh, Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly, She that in wisdom never was so frail To change the cod’s head for the salmon’s tail, She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind, See suitors following and not look behind, She was a wight, if ever such wights were— To do what?","A woman who was beautiful but never proud, who could speak well but knew when to be quiet, who dressed well but was never overdressed, who had self-restraint even when she could get what she wanted, a woman who never took revenge, who overlooked it when people hurt her, who was too wise to do anything stupid, who could think without revealing her thoughts, and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her, that kind of woman, if she ever existed, would— Would do what?"

"Sir, he’s rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may strike at you.","He’s hot-tempered, and he might try to hit you with his staff."
Provoke him that he may.,Try to get him to do that.
"For even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio.","To get what you want, you need to get Cassio out of the way."
